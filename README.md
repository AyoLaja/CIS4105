Version Source control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of
information. Version control systems (VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in
various types of software such as word processors and spreadsheets, e.g Google Docs and Sheets and in various content management systems,
e.g Wikipedia's Page history. Version control systems are important because they act as growth charts for a project, allowing
contributors to stay up to date with each otherâ€™s changes when adding new improvements and features.
